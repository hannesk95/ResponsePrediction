# Therapy Response Prediction

**Goal:** Predict treatment response (binary, multiclass) for tumor patients suffering soft-tissue sarcomas or glioblastomas. Patients underwent chemoradiotherapy and may therefore benefit from non-invasive therapy intensifications in case of accurate prediction performance. \
**Data:** T1 contrast enhanced MRI (soft-tissue sarcoma & glioblastoma) and STIR (soft-tissue sarcoma) / FLAIR (glioblastoma). \
**More details will follow...**
